## Verification

```
<!-- paste test / mypy output here -->
```

## Checklist

- [ ] Branched off `main`; one coherent change per PR
- [ ] Tests added or updated for the change
- [ ] CHANGELOG updated under `## [Unreleased]` (if externally observable)
- [ ] Docs updated in lockstep (README / `CLAUDE.md` / prompt text) if a flag,
      output field, or default changed
- [ ] If a data-model field changed: pass-2 prompt (`context.py`) **and**
      `render.py` updated too
- [ ] I did **not** weaken a security invariant (sensitive-file skip, redaction,
      symlink guard, prompt-injection clause) — or I called it out explicitly below

## Notes for reviewers

<!-- Anything to flag: trade-offs, a security invariant touched, follow-ups. -->
