"""Graph-vs-graph structural diff (GRAPH_DIFF.*).

Computes what changed in the *map* between graphlm's prior ``GRAPH.json`` and
the new one — modules, edges, cycles, data-flows, entry-points, and
file-summaries **added and removed**. This is deliberately *not* a code diff
(git does that better); it reads graphlm's own prior output, which is why the
``meta`` block was made a versioned input contract (ADR-001). Design settled in
DECISIONS.md **ADR-002**.

Key properties (see ADR-002 decisions, referenced inline):

* **Added/removed only, no "changed" bucket** — identity keys are *structural*,
  so a pure prose rewrite (a module description, a summary) reports no change.
  A "changed" bucket over LLM-authored free text would be dominated by
  regeneration noise (decision 2).
* **Three baseline states, never two** — ``first_run`` (no prior file),
  ``uncomparable`` (prior file exists but is corrupt JSON or an unrecognized
  ``schema_version``), and ``normal`` (both parsed). A corrupt file must not
  masquerade as a first run (decision 4).
* **``deterministic_edges`` None vs []** — ``None`` means AST was off
  (``--no-ast``): "not compared", never "all N removed". ``[]`` means AST ran
  and found none, which *is* compared (decision 5).

This module performs pure local computation over two already-materialized
graphs — no network, no LLM call.
