"""Install an agent guide that teaches a coding harness to use graphlm.

``graphlm --install-skill <harness>`` drops a small guide telling a coding agent
(Claude Code, Codex, …) two things: *how to run graphlm*, and *to read
``.graphlm/GRAPH.md`` when it starts working in a codebase* (regenerating the map
with ``graphlm .`` when it is missing or stale).

Design constraints (see ADR-003):

- **Never edit a file graphlm didn't create.** We only ever *create* graphlm's
  own files. For a harness whose config is a user-owned instruction file
  (Codex's ``AGENTS.md``), we write a standalone guide and *print* a one-line
  snippet for the user to include themselves — we don't append to their file.
- **Idempotent.** Skip if the target already exists, unless ``force=True``.
- **User-global by default**, project-local on request.

## Use graphlm's codebase map

[graphlm](https://github.com/ggrace519/graphLM) generates a **map of a
codebase** — modules, import/dependency edges, data flow, entry points, import
cycles, and "where do I find X?" answers — as Markdown, JSON, and interactive
HTML. It lives at `.graphlm/GRAPH.md` (machine-readable `.graphlm/GRAPH.json`;
clickable `.graphlm/GRAPH.html`).

**First, know which situation you're in — the right action differs.**

### A. You were invoked *explicitly* to work with the map

(The user ran the graphlm command/skill directly, with no other task — they want
the map.)

- **If `.graphlm/GRAPH.md` exists:** read it, then briefly tell the user what the
  codebase looks like (its main modules, entry points, any notable import
  cycles). Check the refresh directive (below) and offer to regenerate if stale.
- **If it does NOT exist:** **generate it — run `graphlm .` — without asking.**
  This is the expected outcome of an explicit invocation, and it's a safe,
  local, idempotent action (no network side effects beyond one call to the LLM
  endpoint graphlm is already configured for; it only writes into `.graphlm/`).
  Do **not** stall with a menu or ask permission for this specific command. Then
  read the map you just generated and summarize it. Generation streams and can
  take a minute or two on a large repo — that's normal; let it run.
- Only stop to ask if graphlm is **not installed** or its **LLM endpoint isn't
  configured/reachable** (`graphlm .` will say so) — then tell the user what's
  missing instead of guessing.

### B. You reached for this yourself while doing *another* task

(The user asked for a feature/bug/exploration; you're orienting.)

- **If `.graphlm/GRAPH.md` exists:** read it first — it orients you faster than
  opening files one by one. Follow the refresh directive; a quick
  `git rev-parse HEAD` mismatch means it may be stale.
- **If it does NOT exist:** do **not** generate one mid-task — a fresh generation
  can take minutes and would stall the work the user actually asked for. Just
  note in one line that no map exists (and that `graphlm .` would create one),
  then proceed with the real task normally. Suggest generating it only if the
  user seems to be starting a longer effort in an unfamiliar codebase.

### The refresh directive

`.graphlm/GRAPH.md` opens with a provenance stamp naming the git commit it was
generated against. Compare it to the repo's current `git rev-parse HEAD`; if they
differ, the map may be stale — regenerate with `graphlm .` from the project root.
`.graphlm/GRAPH_DIFF.md` lists what changed (modules, edges, cycles added/removed)
since the previous run.

### Notes

- The map is **advisory** and best-effort. Trust the code over the map when they
  disagree; a stale map is possible (regenerate to be sure).
- graphlm needs an OpenAI-compatible LLM endpoint (`GRAPHLM_BASE_URL` /
  `GRAPHLM_API_KEY` / `GRAPHLM_MODEL`); `graphlm .` will tell you if it's not
  configured. `graphlm --help` lists every flag.
