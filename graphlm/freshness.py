"""Fresh-run cleanup: keep the output dir to exactly the artifacts this run wrote.

When graphlm regenerates a map, any *other* graphlm-owned artifact left in the
output directory is stale — most importantly a ``GRAPH.json`` from an earlier
graphlm version (now written only under ``--json``) or from a run with different
flags. Left behind, an agent could glob that stale machine-readable map beside a
fresh ``GRAPH.md``. This module removes graphlm's own stale artifacts and
detects when the prior map came from a different graphlm version so the diff can
report that honestly instead of masquerading as a first run.

Safety contract (this runs on the write path, *after* the paid LLM call):
- **Never raises.** A failed ``unlink`` logs a warning; the new graph is still
  written. An escaping exception would discard the freshly-generated graph.
- **Exact artifact names only** — derived from the same suffix params
  ``write_outputs`` uses, never a directory and never a glob. ``-o`` is literal
  and may point at a project root full of user files.
- **Skips symlinks** (#33 — graphlm never removes what it did not create).
