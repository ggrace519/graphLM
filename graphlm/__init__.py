    Two-pass strategy:
    1. Send directory tree to LLM → LLM identifies key files to read
    2. Send tree + key files to LLM → LLM produces the final graph

    Args:
        project_dir: Path to the project directory to analyze.
        base_url: LLM API base URL (falls back to GRAPHLM_BASE_URL env var).
        api_key: LLM API key (falls back to GRAPHLM_API_KEY env var).
        model: Model name (falls back to GRAPHLM_MODEL env var).
        output_dir: Where to write GRAPH.md/json/html. None means do not write
            (the CLI defaults to the scanned project directory).
        max_file_chars: Maximum characters to send per file. A longer file is
            sent as its tree-sitter signature skeleton (see ``skeleton``), or
            as its head when no skeleton is available.
        max_files: Maximum files to scan initially.
        max_pass2_files: Maximum files to include in pass 2 context.
        max_context: Maximum context window in tokens. If None, falls back to
            the GRAPHLM_MAX_CONTEXT env var, then to 120000. An explicit value
            (e.g. from the CLI --max-context flag) takes precedence over both.
        timeout: LLM request timeout in seconds. If None, falls back to the
            GRAPHLM_TIMEOUT env var, then to 300. An explicit value (the CLI
            --timeout flag) takes precedence. Pass 2 is streamed, so a large
            project's generation can legitimately take minutes (#18).
        max_output_tokens: Max tokens the model may emit in either LLM pass —
            the `max_tokens` each request sends. A ceiling, not a reservation:
            it is NOT taken out of the input budget (max_context), because input
            and output ceilings are independent on the target endpoint (#25).
            If None, falls back to GRAPHLM_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS env, then
            LLM_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS (the model's practical max). Truncation past
            even this raises a clear GraphLLErrorTruncated.
        include_tests: Whether to include test files in the analysis.
        exclude_patterns: Additional glob patterns to exclude.
        use_graphlmignore: If True (default), merge patterns from a
            ``.graphlmignore`` at the project root. Pass False /
            ``--no-graphlmignore`` to skip the file.
        dry_run: If True, return the scan context without calling the LLM.
        redact_secrets: If True, redact secret-like patterns from file content.
        ast: If True (default), run AST-based deterministic import detection,
            attach those edges to the graph, and pass them to the LLM as
            ground truth. Pass False / --no-ast to skip.
        skeleton: If True (default), a file over ``max_file_chars`` is sent as
            its signature skeleton — imports, class/def headers, docstring
            first lines, short constants, bodies elided — so the model sees the
            whole API surface instead of the first few hundred lines (Python
            only today; other languages still send the head). Pass False /
            --no-skeleton to send the head of the file instead.
        include_html: If output_dir is set, whether to also write GRAPH.html.
        include_diff: If output_dir is set, whether to also write the
            graph-vs-graph diff (GRAPH_DIFF.md/json) against the prior
            GRAPH.json in that directory. On by default; see ADR-002. Never
            reached on a --dry-run (the dry-run branch returns before any write).
        include_evidence: Whether to score the LLM's file summaries against the
            source the model saw (TypeSafe/Jev) into meta.evidence_support. On by
            default, but a no-op (None) unless redaction is on, a TYPESAFE_API_KEY
            is set, and the graphlm[typesafe] extra is installed. Never on a dry
            run (no summaries). Pass False / --no-evidence to skip.
        include_importance: Whether to score each module's semantic architectural
            role (TypeSafe/Jev) and fill ModuleDescription.role/.degree. On by
            default, a no-op (both None) unless a TYPESAFE_API_KEY is set and the
            graphlm[typesafe] extra is installed. NOT gated on redaction (it sends
            descriptions + a degree count, never source). Pass False /
            --no-importance to skip.

    Returns:
        GraphResult with the graph and output metadata.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If configuration is invalid.
        GraphLLError: If the LLM call fails.
