# NOTE: on the target OpenAI-compatible endpoint, input and output ceilings are

# was a false assumption in #17/#18, now unwound (#25). Some other servers

    The request is sent with ``stream: true`` so the response arrives as a
    sequence of ``data: {json}`` lines (OpenAI SSE), terminated by ``data:
    [DONE]``. Streaming is what keeps a long generation alive past a proxy's
    read timeout (Cloudflare 524 — #18): each delta resets the edge timer,
    whereas a single buffered response can exceed it before the first byte.

    Tolerates a **non-SSE** body too: if no ``data:`` line is ever seen, the
    accumulated text is returned as-is and parsed as a plain chat-completions
    JSON object by the caller. This keeps non-streaming test mocks (and any
    server that ignores ``stream``) working unchanged.

    Token usage: the request asks for ``stream_options.include_usage``, so a
    compliant server appends one last chunk *before* ``[DONE]`` whose
    ``choices`` is ``[]`` and whose ``usage`` carries the real prompt /
    completion token counts. That chunk must be inspected **before** the
    empty-``choices`` skip below, or it is silently dropped. A plain (non-SSE)
    completion object carries ``usage`` at top level and is read the same way.
    Usage is optional end to end — absent or malformed, ``usage`` is ``None``.
