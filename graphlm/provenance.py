"""Provenance capture — the git SHA, timestamp, and package version the graph
was generated against.

This is the *only* module in graphlm that reads git or shells out. The feature
that consumes it (the self-refreshing directive in ``render.py``) treats a
missing SHA as normal, not an error, so every function here is failure-tolerant:
a non-git project, git not installed, or an empty/brand-new repo yields
``commit_sha=None`` and never raises.
