"""Render the run-telemetry stamp (`meta.usage` / `.faithfulness` / `.evidence_support`).

Split out of ``render.py`` as a cohesive concern — the ``mermaid.py`` /
``cycles_render.py`` / ``orientation.py`` precedent. These four functions turn
the ``GraphMeta`` telemetry fields into the one ``> **Run telemetry.**`` line
under the refresh directive, and the CLI reuses the per-metric summaries for its
own ``Usage:`` / ``Faithfulness:`` / ``Evidence:`` lines so the wording is
single-sourced. (Module *importance* stays in ``render.py`` — its
``importance_summary`` is tied to the modules-table fusion, not to ``meta``.)
