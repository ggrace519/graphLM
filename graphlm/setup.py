"""First-run setup wizard: offer the optional packs and install the chosen ones.

``graphlm --setup`` (a flag, not a subcommand — ADR-003), and the automatic
first-run prompt, present graphlm's optional extras — the language grammars, the
``mcp`` server, and the ``typesafe`` prose-scoring SDK — and install the selected
ones with the **same installer that put this binary on PATH** (reusing
``upgrade.detect_installer`` and friends). A completion marker
(``~/.config/graphlm/.setup-done``) stops the auto-prompt from firing again.

The optional extras stay optional: nothing here is a hard dependency, and a
``typesafe`` selection is followed by an instruction to add ``TYPESAFE_API_KEY``
so the (separate) evidence feature can activate. This module never uses a shell —
the installer argv is a fixed list, run through an injectable ``runner`` so the
test suite never touches the network. It also never raises past its own boundary:
a failed or refused install prints the manual command and returns, because a
first-run helper must never block the tool.
